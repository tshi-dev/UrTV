# شاشة تلفزيونك (UrTV screensaver) — recreate prompt

Paste everything below the line into any AI that can write a single HTML file. It will rebuild the screen from scratch.

---

## Goal

Build ONE self-contained HTML file (no build step, no external JS libraries) that runs full-screen on a 16:9 TV at 1920×1080 as an always-on screensaver. Arabic only, right-to-left, Riyadh. It must look like a premium Saudi editorial broadcast graphic — photographic and calm, never like a generic dark "dashboard".

## Layout (1920×1080)

One grid with three rows — `grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto`, stage padding `3.1vh 3.6vw 5.4vh`, row gap `1.5vh`.

**Top row — two ends, nothing in between:**
- Left: weather and markets set as type, mirroring the date block on the right — no boxes, no pills.
  - Big line (same size as the Hijri date): the temperature `٣٤°` in the display font, then a short Arabic condition word (`صافي`, `غائم جزئياً`…; `غبار` in gold when PM10 is high).
  - Small line (same size as the Gregorian date): the city `·` high / low `٣٧° / ٢٤°`.
  - A short gold hairline starting at the left screen edge and fading toward the middle.
  - Under it, one quiet line: `تاسي ▼ · S&P 500 ▲ · بيتكوين ▲` — the name plus ONE direction marker only, `▲` `#79D6A0`, `▼` `#EE8B70`. No price, no percentage. If a quote cannot be loaded, hide its marker (never a dash, never a hard-coded direction).
- Right: Hijri date (large, sand `#F6EFE0`) over the Gregorian date (smaller, muted `#C6BBA4`), then a short gold hairline starting at the right screen edge and fading toward the middle.

**Middle row — card left, clock centred in the space between the card and the right edge:**
- Clock `font-size: clamp(120px, min(17vw, 31vh), 345px)` (≈300px tall), `line-height .92`. 12-hour always, Arabic-Indic digits, gold colon, and a small gold `ص`/`م` at `.28em` at the upper left of the time. Under it a tiny muted line `بتوقيت الرياض`.
  - Browsers ignore `letter-spacing` on Arabic script, digits included, and the display font's `٤` reaches into the next digit: put every digit in its own inline box with a `.09em` margin between boxes.
- The card on the left: translucent panel (`rgba(4,14,9,.46)`, 1px gold border, radius 12, backdrop blur), width `min(760px, 48vw)`. Its content is a setting (`#panel=`): new episodes (below, the default), today's prayer times (next one gold, past ones dim), a 5-day forecast, every followed team's games this week, a verse one day and a hadith the next, or no card.
  - Header `هذا الأسبوع` with a gold rule fading out to the left.
  - Exactly 5 rows, each a single flex line: show name (right, `flex:0 1 auto; max-width:68%`, ellipsis), then `الموسم ٣ · ح ٧`, then the rating `٨٫١`, then the weekday anchored at the far left (`flex:1 1 auto; text-align:left`). Hairline under every row.
  - Pool of up to 50 titles, 5 per page, a new page every 25 seconds with a staggered fade-up (`opacity` + `translateY(8px)`, 60ms per row) and wraparound at the end.

**Bottom row — three panels under one gold hairline, `grid-template-columns: 1fr .9fr 1.3fr`, `align-items:start` (the three labels on one line):**
All three are built identically — small gold label, big value, small sub-line — and must read as one set: same sizes, same baseline.
- Right: `الصلاة القادمة` → `الفجر ٥:٣٥ ص` as one big value, sub-line `بعد ٣ ساعات و ٣٧ دقيقة`.
- Centre: `رمضان ١٤٤٨` → the day count at `1.3em` with `يوم` at `.4em` in gold beside it, sub-line the estimated start date.
  - This is the classic bug: keep number and unit in one inline line and give the unit `display:inline-block; transform:translateY(-.8em)` so it lands beside the number instead of dropping underneath and colliding with the sub-line.
- Left: `المباريات` → `الهلال × الحزم` big, sub-line `بعد ٢٠ ساعة · ٩:٠٠ م`. Nothing inside the coming week → `لا شيء هذا الأسبوع` in muted sand at the same size, never an empty box.

## Visual direction

- Background: a real dusk desert photograph (sand dunes, sun low, empty sky, deep shadows), not CSS gradients. Darken with a vertical scrim top and bottom, a soft vignette, and film grain at 4–5% opacity. 120-second ultra-slow scale-and-drift on the photo.
- Palette: sand `#F6EFE0`, warm gold `#C8A45C` / `#D6AF6B`, near-black green `#04120C`, muted text `#C6BBA4`.
- Heavy soft drop shadows behind the clock and big values so they stay legible over the photo.
- No English labels on screen, no emoji, no box around the clock.

## Typography

- Use **Thmanyah** (free, https://font.thmanyah.com). Download the ZIP and embed the weights as base64 `@font-face` so the file works offline: **Sans Light + Regular + Medium** for labels and body, **Serif Display Bold** for the clock, the big values and the empty-match state.
- If Thmanyah is unavailable: body in a low-contrast humanist Arabic sans, clock and numbers in an Arabic display serif with tall, high-contrast digits.
- Arabic-Indic numerals everywhere (`٦٧٧٢٧٣٦٤٧٢`), including the Gregorian date, temperatures, ratings and countdowns. Decimal separator `٫` (U+066B).
- Arabic counted-noun grammar: `١ ساعة`, `ساعتين`, `٣ ساعات` … `١١ ساعة`; same pattern for `يوم` and `دقيقة`.
- All sizes in `clamp()` with `vw`/`vh` — it must still hold together at 1280×720.

## Data (all free, no API keys)

- **Prayer times** — Aladhan, method 4 (Umm al-Qura):
  `https://api.aladhan.com/v1/timings/DD-MM-YYYY?latitude=24.7136&longitude=46.6753&method=4&timezonestring=Asia/Riyadh`
  Only Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha. Refresh every 6 hours; recompute the countdown every second.
- **Ramadan** — never hard-code the date: walk forward day by day with
  `Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-u-ca-islamic-umalqura',{timeZone:'Asia/Riyadh',month:'numeric'})` until the month equals 9.
  Cache the answer per calendar day — that 400-day search must not run once per second.
  The centre panel follows the next occasion the same way (OCCASIONS in the page: Ramadan, عيد الفطر, عشر ذي الحجة,
  يوم عرفة, عيد الأضحى, رأس السنة الهجرية, عاشوراء): days left and the expected date («متوقّع»), «اليوم …» or
  «عيد مبارك» on its days.
- **Hijri date** — `Intl.DateTimeFormat('ar-SA-u-ca-islamic-umalqura',{timeZone:'Asia/Riyadh',weekday:'long',day:'numeric',month:'long',year:'numeric'})`, strip a trailing `هـ` before appending your own. The Ramadan panel's year must also be derived, never a literal `١٤٤٨`.
- **Markets** — Yahoo chart API:
  `https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/{^TASI.SR|^GSPC}?interval=1d&range=5d`
  Compare `regularMarketPrice` with the previous close; only the sign matters. Refresh every 15 minutes.
  Yahoo sends no CORS headers, so a browser cannot call it directly: try it once, and on failure fetch the same URL through `https://api.allorigins.win/get?url=<encoded>` and `JSON.parse(response.contents)`. If both fail, hide the arrow. Allow up to ~30 seconds on first load.
  Bitcoin uses CoinGecko instead (it does send CORS headers):
  `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=bitcoin&vs_currencies=usd&include_24hr_change=true`
  Mind the spelling: the query parameter is `include_24hr_change` but the response key is `usd_24h_change` (no `r`) — accept both.
- **Weather** — Open-Meteo:
  `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=24.7136&longitude=46.6753&current=temperature_2m,weather_code&timezone=Asia/Riyadh`
  Map the WMO `weather_code` to a short Arabic phrase. Refresh every 30 minutes.
- **Premieres** — TVMaze schedules:
  `https://api.tvmaze.com/schedule?country=US&date=YYYY-MM-DD` and `https://api.tvmaze.com/schedule/web?date=YYYY-MM-DD`, for each of the next 7 days.
  Keep `rating.average >= 7`, drop soaps (`genres` includes `Soap`), drop seasons above 15 and any entry without an episode number, dedupe by show name, cap the pool at 50, premieres first then by date.
- **Fixtures** — TheSportsDB test key `123`:
  `eventsnext.php?id=136013` (Al-Hilal) and `?id=136137` (Saudi national team); `eventslast.php?id=…` for results.
  `strTimestamp` has no offset — append `Z`, then render in `Asia/Riyadh`.

## Behaviour

- **Match result window:** once a game ends (status `FT`/`AET`/`PEN`, or kickoff + 2.5h), show the final score (`الهلال ٣ - ٢ الاتحاد`, sub-line `النتيجة النهائية · الأحد`) for 24 hours, then the next fixture. Keep (and save) the score seen at the whistle: the free API's "last games" list lags and "next game" moves on at once.
- **Verse and hadith:** never typed by hand. Verse texts come from an authoritative Quran API; each hadith must be found word for word in the six Sunni books, with those books as its source line. Leave out pause marks your font has no glyph for; take ﷺ and ﴿﴾ from a font that has them.
- **Ramadan mode:** when the Hijri month is 9 the centre panel stops counting down and becomes `الإفطار` with the Maghrib time and the time left; between Maghrib and Fajr it becomes `الإمساك` with the Fajr time.
- **Night dimming:** a full-screen black overlay, transparent from 07:00 to 21:00, ramping over two hours either side, sitting at 46% between 23:00 and 05:00. Recompute every minute.
- **Burn-in protection:** shift the content layer a few pixels through a fixed 7-step sequence every 4 minutes, with a 3-second transition.
- **Background:** one high-resolution Wikimedia Commons photo per Openverse category (nature, ocean, wildlife, cities, Islamic architecture, art, science, space, football, basketball), refreshed daily and rotated every 15 minutes on the screensaver and launcher home. Keep bundled photos as the offline fallback. Show creator, source and licence attributions for online photos; identify Openverse as the discovery source and state that the app is not endorsed by it.
- **Start:** keep the page hidden until the clock, the last saved panels and the photo are ready, then fade in once — never a half-built frame.
- **Arabic descenders:** any line clipped with `overflow:hidden` + ellipsis needs room under the baseline (`padding-bottom:.3em; margin-bottom:-.3em`), or the dots under ي and ج are cut off.
- **Midnight rollover:** at Riyadh 00:00 reload the day-dependent data (prayers, week list, matches, weather). A 6-hour interval alone leaves yesterday's premieres on screen.
- Clock ticks every second (one Intl call); dates, prayer, Ramadan and countdowns refresh every 15 seconds. Zero layout shift. Hide the cursor, block scrolling and selection. `F` toggles fullscreen.

## Hard requirements

- Every fetch in `try/catch` with a fallback. With no network the screen still shows the correct clock, both dates, the Ramadan countdown, a prayer countdown and the known fixture — never a blank cell, never an uncaught error.
- Never fabricate data. If a live value is missing, hide it — never present a hard-coded number as if it were current.
- On a failed refresh keep the last known data (week pool, fixtures, results) instead of blanking the panel.
- Numbers read left-to-right: build the clock from separate spans inside a `direction:ltr` container, or Arabic-Indic digits render in reverse.
- Every API-sourced name (teams, show titles) needs `nowrap` + ellipsis and a `min-width:0` parent, so a long title can never push its neighbour or the panel edge.
- Every `Intl.DateTimeFormat` that puts a weekday or date on screen must pass `timeZone:'Asia/Riyadh'`.
- Do countdown maths from `Intl.DateTimeFormat(...).formatToParts()` (hour × 60 + minute + second/60) instead of rebuilding a `Date` from wall-clock parts — the device timezone must not matter.
- A `CONFIG` object at the top of the script: city, latitude, longitude, timezone, prayer method, team ids, keys.
- Final deliverable: one `.html` with fonts and image inlined as base64, openable by double-click on a TV browser with no server.

## The Android app (what we actually shipped)

- A `DreamService` screensaver (`sa.urtv.screensaver/.ScreenDream`) started by the TV's own idle timer, plus a full-screen preview activity; any remote key closes it.
- The WebView loads a light build of the page (`dist/tv.html`, 0.3 MB); the app answers its font and photo requests from the APK and a photo cache on disk (`shouldInterceptRequest`), so nothing waits on the network.
- Settings: 194 Saudi cities and towns in the 13 regions plus an online place search; up to 20 teams (browse leagues or search TheSportsDB; Arabic names from a table, then Wikidata, then transliteration); the card beside the clock; episode filters. They reach the page as a URL fragment (`#city=..&lat=..&lon=..&teams=id,id&panel=..`) — a `?query` on `file://` fails in WebView.
- Agents set everything over ADB through shell-only broadcast receivers (`optimize/saver.sh`, `optimize/dock.sh`).
- Auto-update: when the screensaver starts, and at most every 6 hours, the app downloads the page from the repo (background thread, one at a time) and uses it if it is newer than the APK.
- TCL quirk: after a power cut the app may stay frozen until opened once; a boot receiver plus a persisted job (which only starts the process, no network) bring it back on most sets.
- Built by Gradle in GitHub Actions on every push and published to the `apk-latest` release.
